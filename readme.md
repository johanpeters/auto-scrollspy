# Auto Scroll Spy
## A Joomla 4 Extension

This extension will allow you to generate a table of contents with scrollspy for your articles automatically.
I know the acronym is A.S.S. That wasn't intentional but I'm too lazy to change it.

### How it works
1. Enable plugin and module
2. Assign module to position you like, ideally in a sidebar
3. Read through plugin settings - all the settings are in the plugin! Not the module
4. Plugin scans for headings at the levels you defined in all articles
5. Module/plugin displays the formatted page menu

* Feature/specs
  * Up to two levels of headings can be  used, for example, it can add every h2 and h3 element to the list, or h3 and h4, and so on...
  * It can auto generate the first item based on page title
  * Bookmark/anchors are automatically generated
  * Scrollspy can be turned on or off, so you can use it just for a table of contents if you want
  * A few different display and color options (default template, dark, and light)
  * Can be published to a module position, or you can display in a floating panel on side of page
  * You can specify minimum # of items to count before making the list, so you don't show a table of contents on short articles

For best results
  * Use consistent heading structure
  * Don't use weird symbols or icons in headings
